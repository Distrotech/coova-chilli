== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.13 svn revision ?) ==

* Added options ''uid'' and ''gid'' to set the process user and group after being started by root (experimental)
* Added option ''noc2c'' to have clients configured with /32 networks - http://coova.org/lists/?0::558
* Expanded the output of ''chilli_query'' to include the input/output octets, the max input/output and total octets, and bandwidth limitation information for each session.
* Added iptables rules to ''etc/chilli/up.sh'' for improved VPN pass-through and PPPoE/Mesh MTU issues.
* Added VSA Attributes ''ChilliSpot-Max-Input-Gigawords'', ''ChilliSpot-Max-Output-Gigawords'', and ''ChilliSpot-Max-Total-Gigawords'' which hold the upper 32 bits of 64bit unsigned integer values for the corresponding ''ChilliSpot-Max-*-Octets'' attributes
* Service-Type for MAC authentication changed to Framed instead of Login
* Added option ''framedservice'' which changes the Service-Type from Login to Framed during normal (non MAC-auth) authentication

* Added ''macreauth'' option to have chilli always re-attempt a MAC authentication when it does an initial redirection
* Added the special ''/macreauth'' URL which will do a MAC re-auth if the ''macauth'' option is true (does not check the ''macreauth'' option which controls the re-auth for initial redirects)
* Added option ''adminupdatefile'' which optionally defines a file to write ChilliSpot-Config administrative user session attributes to - when the file changes, chilli will reread it's configs
* Added options ''challengetimeout'' and ''challengetimeout2'' to control previously hard-coded values for challenge timeout
* Crashing bug fix for when using ''acctupate'' and there is a RADIUS timeout
* Fix to have Acct-Session-Id reset upon Reject from UAM authentication
* Added ''mtu'' option which sets the MTU returned by DHCP

== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.12 svn revision 171) ==

* Bug fix in RADIUS timeout, note that option ''radiustimeout'' is in '''seconds'''!	
* Fix for dnsparanoia whereby chilli will reply with a host not found error instead of dropping the packet [http://coova.org/lists/?0::166 suggest by nextime]
* New option ''macauthdeny'' which will result in the black-listing of devices given an Access-Reject during MAC address authentication
* New internal state called ''splash'' in which clients are given Internet access, but enforcing the port 80 http redirect

== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.3 svn revision 39) ==

* The [http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html gengetopt] project accepted our changes to allow 'include <file>' in config files. The new cmdline.c is generated with gengetopt v2.19 or higher
* Added the ''wpaguests'' option to allow anonymous WPA access w/captive-portal
* Added option for ''localusers'' file to authenticate users from a local file (inspired by FON)
* Commented out the use of clearenv() as it is not on all platforms and not wanted 
* Look for Acct-Session-ID in addition to User-Name in Disconnect-Request - if given, only that specific session is disconnected (thanks to Jeremy Childs for patch)
* Added option ''uamlogoutip'' (default 1.1.1.1) whereby any HTTP request to this address will result in the auto-logout of the associated session
* Support for CoARequest RADIUS requests to reconfigure session parameters (session-timeout, data/bandwidth limits, etc)

* The option ''wwwui'' which when used with ''uamuiport'' is the alternate program to use for local content
* The ''chilli_response'' binary taking 3 arguments <hex-challenge> <uamsecret> <password> and returning the appropriate response
* New options ''postauthproxy'' and ''postauthproxyport'' to configure an upstream transparent proxy to use post-authentication for http traffic

== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.2 svn revision 17) ==

* Configurable TX queue length (option ''txqlen'') on the tun/tap tunnel (Linux only)
* Added option ''swapoctets'' to swap the meaning of input/output octets/packets 
* Added option ''logfacility'' to change the syslog logging facility (default LOG_LOCAL6) [note: should probably change the name of debugfacility as it is really logpriority]
* Patches from the ChilliSpot CVS 1.1 version
** Added option ''conup'' defining a script for session/connection-up
** Added option ''condown'' defining a script for session/connection-down
* Patches contributed by WeSea (see: [http://chillispot.wesea.com/ their page])
** Added option "usestatusfile" to turn on the use of the status file
** Traffic to UAM interface not counted in leaky buckets
** Some tweaks to allow a Flash browser-based UAM solution
* Applied patch for OpenBSD and NetBSD found in ChilliSpot mailing-list
* Renamed and swapped meaning of config param ''uamwispr'' (mentioned below) to ''nouamwispr'' which defaults to ''off'' for compatibility - turn on this option to ''not'' have chilli send WISPr XML, but rather assume the UAM server is taking care of that.
* Renamed and swapped meaning of config param ''uamsuccess'' (mentioned below) to ''nouamsuccess'' which defaults to ''off'' for compatibility - turn on this feature to ''not'' return the user to the UAM server on login, but their original url instead.

== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.1 svn revision 2) ==

* Added the ability to use ''include <filename>'' in configuration files to include others. Using gengetopt version 2.16 and a patch is applied to the generated source.
* A ''chilli_radconfig'' utility to perform a NAS Administrative-User RADIUS login in order to collect configurations (using the new ChilliSpot-Config VSA).
* A ''chilli_query'' utility to interface directly with the chilli server (via a UNIX socket) and retrieve the status of all DHCP leases and sessions. Also, the utility can be used to instruct chilli to release a DHCP lease (and logout the user).
* Added the configuration parameters ''adminuser'' and ''adminpasswd'' which are used by ''chilli_radconfig'' in combination with the other RADIUS (server, secret, port) parameters.
* Fixed the handling of the originally requested URL and the forwarding of said in the UAM initial redirect query string (parameter ''userurl'').
* Passing query string argument ''loginurl'' to ''uamhomepage'' noting the URL to follow to login -- also making the redirect return WISPr directions to use the uamserver URL instead.
* Added the configuration parameter ''wwwdir'' which defines a directory which will serve local files for URLs of format: ''http://<uamlisten>:<uamport>/www/<filename>'' - only supports ''.html'', ''.gif'', and ''.jpg'' extensions.
* Added the configuration parameters ''dhcpstart'', and ''dhcpend'' which define the DHCP ippool range.
* Added the sending of ''hisip'' in the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''cmdsocket'' which is the path of the UNIX socket to use for chilli_query.
* Added the configuration parameter ''ssid'' which gets added to the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''vlan'' which gets added to the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''nasip'' which gets used in the RADIUS NAS-IP-Address attribute (the listen IP is used if not set).
* Added the configuration parameter ''nasmac'' which gets sent to the UAM server in the initial redirect query string as called.
* Added the configuration parameter ''uamwispr'' which turns off and on chilli's internal support for WISPr XML (turned off by default as it is assumed the back-office is driving the XML).
* Added the configuration parameter ''uamsuccess'' which turns off and on whether or not chilli will send the user back to the UAM server (instead of their original URL) once authenticated.
* Swapped input/output octets/packets in RADIUS to be more in-line with other WiFi gateways.
* Allocates "app connections" on demand instead of in bulk to reduce memory usage.
* Rearranged some code to improve the building process and reduce the memory footprint of the additional utilities.
* (Re)Configuration memory leak fixed.
