== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.3 svn revision 39) ==

* The [http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html gengetopt] project accepted our changes to allow 'include <file>' in config files. The new cmdline.c is generated with gengetopt v2.19 or higher
* Added the ''wpaguests'' option to allow anonymous WPA access w/captive-portal
* Added option for ''localusers'' file to authenticate users from a local file (inspired by FON)
* Commented out the use of clearenv() as it is not on all platforms and not wanted 
* Look for Acct-Session-ID in addition to User-Name in Disconnect-Request - if given, only that specific session is disconnected (thanks to Jeremy Childs for patch)
* Added option ''uamlogoutip'' (default 1.1.1.1) whereby any HTTP request to this address will result in the auto-logout of the associated session
* Support for CoARequest RADIUS requests to reconfigure session parameters (session-timeout, data/bandwidth limits, etc)
* New optional flag ''macallowlocal'' which when turned on results in the macallowed list being auto-logged in with any RADIUS (local "authentication")
* Port and protocol allowed in the ''uamallowed'' to allow for a more specific definition of the walled-garden
* Add option for ''uamuiport'' which is an alternate port for embedded local content (where as uamlisten/uamport is also used to grab the initial redirect)
* The option ''wwwbin'' which, when configured, is the program used to deliver local content (in the ''wwwdir'') with the extention ".chi" (perfect for haserl)
* The option ''wwwui'' which when used with ''uamuiport'' is the alternate program to use for local content
* The ''chilli_response'' binary taking 3 arguments <hex-challenge> <uamsecret> <password> and returning the appropriate response
* New options ''postauthproxy'' and ''postauthproxyport'' to configure an upstream transparent proxy to use post-authentication for http traffic
* Option ''papalwaysok'' to allow back-ward compatibility with UAM back-end's using PAP authentication (with ''password'') even when configured with a ''uamsecret''

== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.2 svn revision 17) ==

* Configurable TX queue length (option ''txqlen'') on the tun/tap tunnel (Linux only)
* Added option ''swapoctets'' to swap the meaning of input/output octets/packets 
* Added option ''logfacility'' to change the syslog logging facility (default LOG_LOCAL6) [note: should probably change the name of debugfacility as it is really logpriority]
* Patches from the ChilliSpot CVS 1.1 version
** Added option ''conup'' defining a script for session/connection-up
** Added option ''condown'' defining a script for session/connection-down
* Patches contributed by WeSea (see: [http://chillispot.wesea.com/ their page])
** Added option "usestatusfile" to turn on the use of the status file
** Traffic to UAM interface not counted in leaky buckets
** Some tweaks to allow a Flash browser-based UAM solution
* Applied patch for OpenBSD and NetBSD found in ChilliSpot mailing-list
* Renamed and swapped meaning of config param ''uamwispr'' (mentioned below) to ''nouamwispr'' which defaults to ''off'' for compatibility - turn on this option to ''not'' have chilli send WISPr XML, but rather assume the UAM server is taking care of that.
* Renamed and swapped meaning of config param ''uamsuccess'' (mentioned below) to ''nouamsuccess'' which defaults to ''off'' for compatibility - turn on this feature to ''not'' return the user to the UAM server on login, but their original url instead.

== ChangeLog (Coova Chilli v1.0.1 svn revision 2) ==

* Added the ability to use ''include <filename>'' in configuration files to include others. Using gengetopt version 2.16 and a patch is applied to the generated source.
* A ''chilli_radconfig'' utility to perform a NAS Administrative-User RADIUS login in order to collect configurations (using the new ChilliSpot-Config VSA).
* A ''chilli_query'' utility to interface directly with the chilli server (via a UNIX socket) and retrieve the status of all DHCP leases and sessions. Also, the utility can be used to instruct chilli to release a DHCP lease (and logout the user).
* Added the configuration parameters ''adminuser'' and ''adminpasswd'' which are used by ''chilli_radconfig'' in combination with the other RADIUS (server, secret, port) parameters.
* Fixed the handling of the originally requested URL and the forwarding of said in the UAM initial redirect query string (parameter ''userurl'').
* Passing query string argument ''loginurl'' to ''uamhomepage'' noting the URL to follow to login -- also making the redirect return WISPr directions to use the uamserver URL instead.
* Added the configuration parameter ''wwwdir'' which defines a directory which will serve local files for URLs of format: ''http://<uamlisten>:<uamport>/www/<filename>'' - only supports ''.html'', ''.gif'', and ''.jpg'' extensions.
* Added the configuration parameters ''dhcpstart'', and ''dhcpend'' which define the DHCP ippool range.
* Added the sending of ''hisip'' in the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''cmdsocket'' which is the path of the UNIX socket to use for chilli_query.
* Added the configuration parameter ''ssid'' which gets added to the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''vlan'' which gets added to the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''nasip'' which gets used in the RADIUS NAS-IP-Address attribute (the listen IP is used if not set).
* Added the configuration parameter ''nasmac'' which gets sent to the UAM server in the initial redirect query string as called.
* Added the configuration parameter ''uamwispr'' which turns off and on chilli's internal support for WISPr XML (turned off by default as it is assumed the back-office is driving the XML).
* Added the configuration parameter ''uamsuccess'' which turns off and on whether or not chilli will send the user back to the UAM server (instead of their original URL) once authenticated.
* Swapped input/output octets/packets in RADIUS to be more in-line with other WiFi gateways.
* Allocates "app connections" on demand instead of in bulk to reduce memory usage.
* Rearranged some code to improve the building process and reduce the memory footprint of the additional utilities.
* (Re)Configuration memory leak fixed.
