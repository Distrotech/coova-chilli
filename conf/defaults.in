#   HotSpot settings for simple Captive Portal

#   Optional initial redirect and RADIUS settings
# HS_SSID=<ssid>	   # To send to the captive portal
# HS_NASMAC=<mac address>  # To explicitly set Called-Station-Id
# HS_NASIP=<ip address>    # To explicitly set NAS-IP-Address

#   Use HS_UAMFORMAT to define the actual captive portal url.
#   Shell variable replacement takes place when evaluated, so here
#   HS_UAMSERVER is escaped and later replaced by the pre-defined 
#   HS_UAMSERVER to form the actual "--uamserver" option in chilli.
HS_UAMFORMAT=http://\$HS_UAMSERVER/uam/

#   Same principal goes for HS_UAMHOMEPAGE.
